# 🌐 Day 1 - HTML Basics

Welcome to **Day 1** of the HTML learning journey!  
This file explains the HTML code written today, the concepts learned, and key takeaways.

---

## 📌 Code Overview
On Day 1, we covered the **basics of HTML structure, attributes, headings, paragraphs, images, links, and text formatting**.  
The goal was to understand how HTML elements are written and how attributes modify their behavior.

---

## 🏷️ Topics Covered

### 1. Basic Structure
- `<html>`, `<head>`, `<title>`, `<body>`
- Sets up the foundation of any HTML page.

### 2. Headings
- Used `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags.
- Larger number = smaller heading.

### 3. Paragraphs
- `<p>` creates text paragraphs.
- Attributes like `align`, `style`, and `title` were tested.

### 4. Horizontal Rule
- `<hr>` was used to visually separate sections.

### 5. Images
- `<img>` tag with:
  - `src` → Defines the image source (URL).
  - `alt` → Alternative text if image doesn’t load.
  - `width` and `height` → Control image dimensions.

### 6. Links
- `<a>` tag with `href` attribute to link to external websites.
- `title` shows a tooltip when hovered.

### 7. Style Attribute
- Used inline CSS with `style="..."` to change:
  - text color  
  - background color  
  - font size  
  - font family  
  - text alignment  

### 8. Preformatted Text
- `<pre>` displays text as it is (with spaces and line breaks preserved).

### 9. Text Formatting Tags
- `<b>` and `<strong>` → Bold text  
- `<i>` and `<em>` → Italic / emphasized text  
- `<mark>` → Highlighted text  
- `<small>` → Smaller text  
- `<del>` → Strikethrough (deleted text)  
- `<ins>` → Inserted/underlined text  
- `<sub>` → Subscript (e.g., H₂O)  
- `<sup>` → Superscript (e.g., x²)

## 💡 Key Learnings
1. Basic HTML page structure.  
2. How attributes modify elements (`src`, `alt`, `title`, `style`, etc.).  
3. Difference between block-level (like `<p>`, `<h1>`) and inline tags (like `<b>`, `<i>`).  
4. First use of inline styling with `style` attribute.  
5. How to link external sites using `<a href="">`.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps
- Learn about **lists** (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`).  
- Explore **tables** (`<table>`, `<tr>`, `<td>`, `<th>`).  
- Understand **forms** (`<form>`, `<input>`, `<label>`, `<textarea>`).  
- Move towards **semantic HTML** (`<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, etc.).
